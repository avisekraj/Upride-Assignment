# Upride Assignment

This project is a **multi-step form application** built as part of an assignment to demonstrate React and Next.js skills including component-based architecture, state management, and UI design.

## Project Overview

The app guides users through a two-step process to select and customize their two-wheeler training:

### Step 1: Ride Selection
- Choose your preferred vehicle type from options including **Car**, **Bike**, **Auto**, and **Truck**.
- This selection helps customize the training options relevant to the chosen ride.

### Step 2: Course Selection and Add-Ons
- Choose a training course level: **Beginner**, **Advanced**, or **Custom**.
- Select optional add-ons like a **Two-Wheeler License**.
- View a detailed price summary including program price, add-ons, GST, and any discounts.
- Apply a coupon code to receive a discount if available.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** (React framework)
- **React hooks** for state management
- **TypeScript** for type safety
